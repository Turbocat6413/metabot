The Twitter accounts this extension highlights are exactly those selected by Twitter user @antibot4navalny as likely Kremlin bots (Russian orchestrated crowd of human trolls for hire), as publicly listed at BlockTogether:
https://blocktogether.org/show-blocks/HYZ_Qq1P1xyxcDDbgLQ3l8OhhFLAolDZvpUqHP3A

The list is manually created and maintained according to these criteria:
https://twitter.com/antibot4navalny/status/1060437615399354368

Your Twitter username may be pre-filled into:
1) both "new likely bot" and "consider unlisting" reports when they are sent via Google Forms;
2) into extension's "uninstall survey" Google Form.

You can manually remove your Twitter username before submitting either of the Google Forms, thus choosing to stay anonymous.
