The following is currently only used in Stable, not in Early Access (maybe it will change in future):
- `update_git_version.sh`: because currently there's no long-lasting periods of testers-only access with regular update of prepacked labels
- `update.(template.)xml`: because Early-Access version is not public at the moment

Only in Early Access:
- `experiments/`: has (limited) value for development team only


TODO: decide and document whether `next_version.txt` counters should (not) be related between Stable and Early Access.
